# Integration with prosora.in

## Linking Strategy

Once deployed, integrate this Product Idea Assistant with your main website at prosora.in:

### 1. Add to Navigation/Projects Section

Add a new section or update existing projects page:

```html
<div class="project-card">
  <h3>Product Idea Assistant</h3>
  <p>AI-powered tool for generating innovative product ideas using Google Gemini</p>
  <div class="project-links">
    <a href="https://ideas.prosora.in" target="_blank">Try Live Demo</a>
    <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/product-idea-assistant">View Source</a>
  </div>
  <div class="tech-stack">
    <span>Next.js</span>
    <span>Gemini AI</span>
    <span>TypeScript</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

### 2. Blog Post Announcement

### 3. Embed Option (Advanced)
